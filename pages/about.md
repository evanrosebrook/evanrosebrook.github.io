# About Me

I am Evan Rosebrook. I build software, I enjoy my family and sometimes I hike. Building software is something I truly enjoy and I take pride in doing great work. Most recently my work has been focused around building stream and batch processing platforms. It is an area that is growing rapidly and it never gets boring. There is always something new to learn and new tools to add to the tool belt.
